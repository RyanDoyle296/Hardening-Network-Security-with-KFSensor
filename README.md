# Hardening-Network-Security-with-KFSensor

In this project, I set up a honeypot using KFSensor on a Windows 10 VM to monitor network traffic and identify open ports. I used Nmap from my host machine to perform port scans, reflecting real-time changes in KFSensor. After configuring Windows Firewall to harden the VMâ€™s security, a subsequent Nmap scan confirmed that many ports were no longer exposed, demonstrating improved security posture.
